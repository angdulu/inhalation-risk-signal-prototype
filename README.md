# Inhalation Risk Signal Interpreter

This is a research-grade prototype that translates household chemical ingredients
into inhalation-related risk signals.

## Purpose
This project does not predict harm or label products as safe or dangerous.
Instead, it summarizes mechanism-based inhalation exposure signals,
explicitly highlights uncertainty, and prioritizes source transparency.

## Design Principles
- Pattern-based (mechanism-driven), not ingredient-list-based
- No safety verdicts or predictions
- Explicit uncertainty when data is insufficient
- Inspired by lessons from the Korean humidifier disinfectant disaster (PHMG-P)

## Current Scope
- Inhalation exposure only
- Household spray and aerosol products
- 5–10 representative inhalation risk patterns

## Future Work
This framework is designed to be extended to ingestion and carcinogenic risk assessment,
including food additives and long-term exposure pathways.
